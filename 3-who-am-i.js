/*Write a program that creates a secret random number between 1 and 100 and asks the user to guess it. 
After each guess, it should tell the user if their guess was too big, too small, or exactly right.

Write another program that asks the user to think of a secret number (but they shouldn't tell the program what it is!) and then the program tries to guess it. 
After each guess the program makes, the user needs to tell the program if the guess was too big, too small, or exactly right.

Can you make your program always succeed in 8 guesses? Can you make your program detect when the user has lied to it?*/

//write rng for 1-100
//first guess if statement compares guess to rn and determines bigger/smaller/correct
